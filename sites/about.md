Hi, I'm Mateusz but here I'm mat3usz and I'm software engineer with experience in React Native. I'm really interested in cyber security espessialy in mobile application and devices security. In my free time I like to resolve CTFs, you can find some of my walkthrough on this blog. Hopefully you find there something interesting for you.
