Hi, I'm Mateusz but here I'm mat3usz and I'm software engineer with experience in React Native and Python. I'm really interested in cyber security espessialy in mobile application and devices security. Currently I work in one of the biggest software company in Central Europe. In my free time I like to resolve CTFs, you can find some of my walkthrough on this blog. Hopefully you find there something interesting for you.
